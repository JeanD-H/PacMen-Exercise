PacMen Exercise

Description

The PacMen Exercise is a program where PacMen placed at random when you click on the ‘Add PacMen’ button. When you click ‘Start Game’ button, the PacMen start to move in different direction and with different speeds. The PacMen Bounce off of the screen boundaries.

How to Run

Fork and clone this repo. Once the files are downloaded load the HTML file in a Web Browser.Then click the buttons in any order you feel like, and enjoy.

Roadmap to Future Improvements:

Make PacMen images change as the images bounce around.
Set buttons so that they can be pressed even if covered by PacMen.
Widen the random proportions so that the PacMen appear all over the screen and not just in one area.
